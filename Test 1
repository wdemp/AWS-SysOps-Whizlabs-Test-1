Q: Your company currently has a VPC with EC2 Instances. A new instance being launched which will host an application that works on IPv6. 
ou need to ensure that this instance can initiate traffic outgoing to the Internet. At the same time, you need to ensure 
that no incoming connection can be initiated from the Internet on to the Instance. Which of the following would you add 
to the VPC for this requirement?

A: An egress only internet gateway
Answer I put: NAT Gateway
Reason: Was mostly guessing. I still don't fully understand all the network based terminology.
Whizlabs and AWS docs answers: The Egress only internet gateway is used specifically for the IPV6. According to AWS docs "
IPv6 addresses are globally unique and are therefore public by default. If you want your instance to be able to access the Internet, but you want 
to prevent resources on the Internet from initiating communication with your instance, you can use 
n egress-only Internet gateway."
